# Task

Create a list of the most popular artists on Last.fm by country. 

The user should be able to enter a keyword (country name), which is then used to search Last.fm api. 

The search results should be paginated and displayed as five results per page, and the user should be able to navigate to other pages (browsable). 

Each result should be displayed as the name of the band and a thumbnail of the band; clicking on the thumbnail should open a new page which shows the Artist Top Tracks. 

Keep in mind that your solution should work efficiently, no matter how many results match the keyword.
